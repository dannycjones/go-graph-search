# Go Graph Search

This is just where an example Go implementation of graph search I created for practise.

## How to use

`go run <somefile.go> <inputfile>`

An example input file is included as `example-input.txt` based on the [Jumping on the Clouds challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jumping-on-the-clouds/problem) on HackerRank.
