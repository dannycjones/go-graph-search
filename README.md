# Go Graph Search

[![GoReport](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/dannycjones/go-graph-search)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/dannycjones/go-graph-search)

This is just where an example Go implementation of graph search I created for practice.

## How to use

`go run <somefile.go> <inputfile>`

An example input file is included as `example-input.txt` based on the [Jumping on the Clouds challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jumping-on-the-clouds/problem) on HackerRank.

The format is simply:
- First line states number of vertices
- Each subsequent line states the indices of the adjacent vertices
